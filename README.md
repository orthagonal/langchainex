### Overview

Loosely inspired by [LangChainJs](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs)
This library seeks to enable core LangChain functionality but using
Elixir and OTP idioms. It provides low-level structures
you can use to build your own language chain applications
as well as high-level GenServers for accomplishing common 
natural-language processing tasks very quickly. 

Under current development with new backend providers and features added every few days.


## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:langchainex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```


## tl;dr GenServers 

### Scraper

Scraper holds language chains that extract structured data
from natural language text. It has a handy "default_scraper" that
can be used out of the box.


In your Application tree:
```elixir
  {LangChain.Scraper, name: :scraper},
```

In your code: 
```elixir
  description = "Hi I'm Nermal an 11th-level magic user with 30 hit points, I have a wand of healing and a cloak of protection in my inventory."

  character_schema = "{
    name: String,
    class: String,
    hit_points: Int,          
    inventory: [String]
  }"

  {:ok, result } = LangChain.Scraper.scrape(:scraper, description, "default_scraper", %{ output_format: "YAML", input_schema: character_schema }) 

  IO.puts result.text 
  " name: Nermal
    class: magic user
    hit_points: 30
    inventory:
      - wand of healing
      - cloak of protection
  "
    end
```

## LangChain Components 

 LangChainEx chains are composed in a hierarchical manner, starting at 
 the most fundamental component and going up it is:

- PromptTemplate
- ChainLink
- Chain
  
 PromptTemplates are just text templates. ChainLinks wrap a PromptTemplate , which are composed of PromptTemplates. 

Components you can use to construct your own language chains
